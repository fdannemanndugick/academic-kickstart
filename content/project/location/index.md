A series of near-surface explosive events from the Utah Test and Training Range are used to assess infrasonic  location  capability.  Ground  truth  information,  in  the  form  of  explosion  location  and origin  time  is  refined  utilizing  a  nearby  seismic  station.    Precise  arrival  times  were  determined using  an  automatic  F-statistic  based  signal  detector  along  with  an  analyst  waveform  review.  We  apply  a  series  of  propagation-based priors to better estimate atmospheric propagation from source to receiver.  Application of priors does not change event location estimates for events detected by 5-7 stations.  Application improves location for events detected by 2-4 stations.

In preparation for submission to the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America
