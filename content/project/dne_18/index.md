The Dynamic Network Experiment 2018 (DNE 2018) was a virtual experiment designed to quantitatively assess current capabilities for multi-modal data ingestion and processing for nuclear explosion monitoring at the local and regional scale.  The experiment was a collaborative effort between Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Sandia National Laboratory (SNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  One component of the experiment was the establishment of a baseline for infrasonic signal detection, as well as the development of an event catalog across the network.  This baseline was established using proprietary infrasonic data processing packages at both LANL (InfraPy) and SNL (Bloodhound). The analysis of an identical data set with a similar set of processing parameters allows for a direct comparison of the algorithms utilized in each processing pipeline.  Detection catalogs are compared against both each other and an analyst-produced catalog to quantify detector performance in terms of precision and recall.  Subsequent event association and location catalogs are compared in terms of completeness and measures of error.  This expands upon previously published studies comparing the performance of automatic infrasonic signal detectors, as well as presents the first known comparison of event association and detection algorithms.
