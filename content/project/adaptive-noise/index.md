We explore factors influencing signal detection, and assess automatic detection performance, for a regional infrasound network of arrays in the western US using signals from ground truth missile motor and propellant explosions at the Utah Test and Training Range with yields from 1665-17651 kg.  Arrays are primarily distributed towards the SSE and SSW at distances between 85-410 km of the source, with one array offering azimuthal resolution towards the northeast.  Events occurred through the spring, summer and fall of 2012, with the majority in the months of June, July and August.  Depending upon station, automatic detection utilizing the Adaptive F-Detector successfully identifies between 14 and 80% of the ground-truth events, while a subsequent analyst review increases successful detection to 24-90%.  A combination of background noise assessment, atmospheric propagation analysis, and a comparison of spectral amplitudes are used to determine the mechanisms contributing to missed detections across the network.  Between 5-47% of missed detections can primarily be attributed to propagation path effects due to atmospheric dynamics which is directly related to relative positioning between the source and receivers within the network.  The remainder of missed detections are additionally attributed to correlated and uncorrelated background noise.
